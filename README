1. OVERVIEW:


    This repository contains a wrapper script and configuration files to allow the user to set up 
    the avocado test framework and run a suite of tests to help verify the OpenPOWER Host OS and 
    Guest Virtual Machine (VM) stability.  The tests are integrated into the avocado framework to 
    increase the overall ease of use and to allow the open source community to easily add and run 
    new tests within the suite.

    See the REFERENCE section below for links to the avocado framework and avocado documentation.


2. OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORT:

    *Running this test suite against unsupported Host or Guest VM operating systems may result
     in multiple test failures - proceed at your own risk.

    The preconfigured Host tests within the Host OS Test Suite currently support the following
    operating systems on POWER8 hardware:
      - CentOS 7.2

    The preconfigured Guest VM tests within the Host OS Test Suite currently support the following
    VM operating systems:
      - Fedora 23 ppc64le
      - Fedora 24 ppc64le
      - CentOS 72 ppc64le

    This section will be updated as new Host OS or Guest VM support is added. 


3. PREREQUISITES:

    The "avocado-setup.py" script must always be run as root or as a user with root privileges 
    or you risk permission denied errors. 

    The script will check your environment for tooling prerequisites and issue a warning/error 
    if any prerequisites are not installed on the system and cannot be installed automatically.


    GUEST VM INSTALL MANUAL PREREQUISITES:

      Before installing the Guest VM ("--install" option used), you must complete the following manual tasks:

        1) Place the ISO image for the guest OS in the isos/ folder.  The install option 
           currently supports only the Fedora 23 and 24 OS ISO & guest.

           Link to the currently supported Guest VM Fedora ISO: 
             >> https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/23/Server/ppc64le/iso/Fedora-Server-DVD-ppc64le-23.iso
             >> https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/24/Server/ppc64le/iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-ppc64le-24-1.2.iso

           Note: This step is not required for CentOS 7.2 guest Installation, as it would pick up automatically.

        2) Open firewall ports 8000-8020. They are needed by the avocado test framework 
           to host the kickstart file for the guest using the default bridge network.

           Suggested iptables command:  
             >> iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p tcp -m state --dport 8000:8020 --state NEW -j ACCEPT


4. "avocado-setup.py" SCRIPT USAGE INFORMATION:


    It is highly recommended for users to execute the following command as root when running the 
    test suite for the first time or you risk permission denied errors.  See the below information
    for details:

      --install                   Install the Guest VM. Highly recommended for guest tests.


    ARGUMENT DETAILS:

      --bootstrap
        Use this option to bootstrap the environment so that all of the required repositories 
        (avocado, avocado-vt, avocado-misc-tests) are downloaded, installed, and configured.


          Example command to bootstrap the test suite: 
              >> python avocado-setup.py --bootstrap


      --run-suite RUN_SUITE
        Use this option to reference one of the files in the config/tests/host/ or
        config/tests/guest/{libvirt, qemu} folders. The RUN_SUITE value must be
        prefixed based on which folder (guest or host) the config file is located
        in.  Multiple RUN_SUITE values must be separated by a comma.

        Preconfigured possible RUN_SUITE values:

          host_sanity -->  Uses the preconfigured file:
                           config/tests/host/sanity.cfg
                           This file lists the specific scripts that are run from
                           the Avocado Test Framework "avocado-misc-tests"
                           repository.

            Example command to run the preconfigured Host OS test suite only: 
                >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite host_sanity


          guest_sanity --> Uses the preconfigured file:
                           config/tests/guest/libvirt/sanity.cfg
                           This file runs a full series of regular and error
                           injection tests against the specified guest VM using
                           various virsh commands. This set of tests can take 4-5
                           hours to complete.  The "variants:" section of the
                           config file shows which commands are tested.

          Example command to install a new Guest VM and run the preconfigured full 
          guest test suite against it: 
              >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite guest_sanity --install


          guest_short_sanity --> Uses the preconfigured file:
                                 config/tests/guest/libvirt/short_sanity.cfg
                                 This file runs a shorter series of tests against
                                 the specified guest VM using various virsh
                                 commands. This set of tests can take 1-2 hours to
                                 complete.  The "variants:" section of the config
                                 file shows which commands are tested.

          Example command to install a new Guest VM and run the preconfigured short 
          guest test suite against it: 
              >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite guest_short_sanity --install


      --output-dir
        Use this option to provide a custom directory for avocado test results.
        The avocado test results are stored in the /current_run_path/results folder by default.

        Example command to run the host and guest test suite and output the test results to the
        /tmp folder:
            >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite guest_sanity,host_sanity --output-dir /tmp

        NOTE: The avocado-setup.py log will always be generated at 
              /current_run_path/avocado-wrapper.log


      --verbose
        Use this option to display test verbose output on the console.

        Example command to install a new guest VM, run the full host & guest test suites, and 
        display verbose output on the console: 
            >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite guest_sanity,host_sanity --install --verbose


      --only-filter
        Use this option to add additional specific avocado tests or features to the guest test suite. 
        This filter option is for advanced users of the avocado test framework who want to 
        temporarily adjust the tests being run without having to create or change configuration 
        files.

        Example command to run the host & guest test suites and add "scsi virtio_net" filter to 
        the guest test suite: 
            >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite guest_sanity,host_sanity --install --only-filter "scsi virtio_net"

        IMPORTANT: Ensure you do not include a filter in the command that is a duplicate of a filter 
                   in the guest test suite being run.  This could cause avocado test errors. 


      --no-filter
        Use this option to remove specific avocado tests or features from the guest test suite. 
        This filter option is for advanced users of the avocado test framework who want to 
        temporarily adjust the tests being run without having to create or change configuration 
        files.

        Example command to run the host & guest test suites and remove the "scsi virtio_net" filter 
        from the guest test suite: 
            >> python avocado-setup.py --run-suite guest_sanity,host_sanity --install --no-filter "scsi virtio_net"

        IMPORTANT: Ensure you do not include a filter in the command that is a duplicate of a filter 
                   in the guest test suite being run.  This could cause avocado test errors. 


      --additional-args
        Use this option to pass any additional avocado arguments to run tests. A
        preconfigured set of Host or Guest VM tests has already been provided and
        will run based on the value chosen for --run-suite. This additional option
        is for advanced users of the avocado test framework who want to run
        additional tests within that framework.


      --guest-os
        Use this option to specify the guest os for the guest tests to run against.
        By default, the value is Fedora.24.ppc64le.
        Supported Guests: Fedora.24.ppc64le, Fedora.23.ppc64le, CentOS.7.2.ppc64le

        IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended that you only specify a guest os from the list
                   of supported guest vm's in the above Operating System Support section.


      --vt {qemu or libvirt}
        Use this option to choose either the libvirt or qemu folder when guest_sanity 
        is the RUN_SUITE value.  By default, the libvirt folder is used.


      --install
        Use this option to install the guest VM before or during the first time that you 
        run any guest test suite.  Advanced avocado users may install their guest vm
        separately, but the install must follow the strict avocado configuration rules.
      

        IMPORTANT: Complete all Guest VM Install prerequisites listed in the Prerequisites
                   section above BEFORE running this script with the "--install" option.


5. CUSTOMIZING TEST SUITES

   The Host and Guest sanity suites were created to include a varied collection of tests to validate new Host OS installations. 
   There are additional tests that were not included in the sanity suites that users can optionally add if they wish.
   
   Adding Guest Sanity Tests:
      You must be a proficient/advanced Avocado test suite user to correctly customize the Guest sanity suites since the syntax of these
      configuration files is very specific.
   
   Adding Host Sanity Tests:
      The Host sanity tests are listed in the config/tests/host/sanity.cfg file in this repository.  These are tests used directly 
      from the avocado-misc-tests respository (see link in the REFERNCE LINKS section below).  If you want to run additional 
      tests from this repository, simply add a new line in the sanity.cfg file with the location of the file within the 
      avocado-misc-tests repository.
      
      For Example:  
         - A user wishes to run ras.py test in the generic folder of the avocado-misc-tests repository. The purpose of this 
         test is documented within the file itself.  
         - The exact location of this test in the repository is "generic/ras.py".
         - The user downloads this tests repository onto their system and edits the config/tests/host/sanity.cfg file.
         - The user adds a line "avocado-misc-tests/generic/ras.py" (without the quotes) to the end of the config/tests/host/sanity.cfg 
         file in this tests repository and saves the file.
         - The user runs the host_sanity suite using the avocado-setup.py script explained in Section 4 above.
